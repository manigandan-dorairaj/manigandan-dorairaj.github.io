Not just for businesses, a website is a powerful tool for individuals to enhance their visibility, create a personal brand, connect with people, showcase skills and talent,  share knowledge, and bring  opportunities.

### Who provides free hosting services

However, they display Ads on the site. It is user-friendly to create and manage content, but it comes with a cost of some performance delays.  If you are tech-savvy or a software developer, you can choose **GitHub Pages**.

### How to host your site for free in GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

### Steps to create a site

#### 1. Create a repository

Sign up with [GitHub](https://github.com/signup){:target="_blank"}. Create a repository with your GitHub username. The site address will be `https://[github-username].github.io`. If you want a different name, create a new organization with the desired name (subject to availability). Your site address will be `https://[orgname].github.io`.
