### Importance of Website

A website makes it easy for people to find your company, discover what you do, and answers a bunch of questions they have on your business. It helps create brand awareness, increases sales, improves customer experience, serves as a media to publish updates and announcements.

Not just for businesses, a website is a powerful tool for individuals to enhance their visibility, create a personal brand, connect with people, showcase skills and talent,  share knowledge, bring  opportunities.

### Free hosting platforms

 [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com){:target="_blank"} and [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"} provide free hosting options.
However, they display Ads on the website. It is user friendly to create and manage content but it comes with a cost of some performance delays.  If you are tech savvy or a developer, you can choose **Github Pages**.

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

### Steps to create a site

#### Create a repository

Sign-up with GitHub. Create a repository with your github user name. The site address will be `https://[github-username].github.io`. If you want a different name, create a new organization with the desired name (subject to availability). Your site address will be then `https://[orgname].github.io`.

#### Configure GitHub Pages

In order to create and publish your site, a configuration is needed. Go to the repository settings and select **Pages** from the left menu. Select the branch and directory of website source. By default it is master branch and root directory.
