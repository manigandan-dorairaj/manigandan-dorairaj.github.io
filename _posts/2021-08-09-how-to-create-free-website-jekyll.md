In the [previous post](how-to-host-a-free-website), we learned how to create a basic site using GitHub Pages. In this post, we will look at using Jekyll to create a website.


#### Jekyll

[Jekyll]{:target="_blank"} is a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator){:target="_blank"}. It takes text written in Markdown or HTML language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

#### Why Jekyll

1. Easy to learn and use: Jekyll has a simple and straightforward structure that is easy to learn and use, even for people  without extensive programming experience.

2. Speed and performance: Jekyll generates static HTML pages that load quickly, resulting in faster page load times and improved performance for your website.

3. Customizable: Jekyll is highly customizable, allowing you to create a unique design for your website or blog.

4. Portability: Jekyll is a Ruby-based platform, which means that it can be easily deployed on most web servers or hosted on popular platforms like GitHub Pages.

5. Markdown support: Jekyll has built-in support for Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows you to write content in plain text, making it easier to create and format content.

6. Large community: Jekyll has a large and active community of developers and users, which means that there are plenty of resources available for troubleshooting and support.

7. Cost-effective: Jekyll is free and open source, which means that there are no licensing fees or ongoing costs associated with using it.

#### Installation

#### Local Build

You can create a new site using `jekyll new myblog` command and preview on your system using `bundle exec jekyll serve` command.
The site will be running on `http://localhost:4000`
